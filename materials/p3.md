## What is Railties?

Railties is the core of Rails.<br/>
It provides Engine, Railtie, Application, etc..

[railties.gemspec](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/4-2-stable/railties/railties.gemspec#L7-L8)
```
s.summary     = 'Tools for creating, working with, and running Rails applications.'
s.description = 'Rails internals: application bootup, plugins, generators, and rake tasks.'
...
s.executables = ['rails']
```

[rails/commands.rb](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/4-2-stable/railties/lib/rails/commands.rb#L15-L17)
```
require 'rails/commands/commands_tasks'
Rails::CommandsTasks.new(ARGV).run_command!(command)
```
This responsible for invoke a command task with the given name.

[commands/commands_tasks.rb](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/4-2-stable/railties/lib/rails/commands/commands_tasks.rb#L73)
```
module Rails
  class CommandsTasks

    def server
      set_application_directory!
      require_command!('server')

      Rails::Server.new.tap do |server|
        ...
        server.start
      end
    end

  end
end
```
CommandsTasks#server requires 'rails/commands/server'.

[commands/server.rb](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/4-2-stable/railties/lib/rails/commands/server.rb#L4)
```
require 'rails'

module Rails
  class Server < ::Rack::Server

    def initialize(*)
      super
      ENV['RAILS_ENV'] ||= options[:environment]
    end

    def start
      ...
      super
    end

  end
end
```
Rails::Server requires 'rails' (rails.rb file at the top of lib directory).

[lib/rails.rb](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/4-2-stable/railties/lib/rails.rb#L11)
```
require 'rails/application'

module Rails
  ...
end
```
This defines a top-level module named Rails, and requires 'rails/application'.

[rails/application.rb](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/4-2-stable/railties/lib/rails/application.rb#L7)
```
require 'rails/engine'

module Rails
  class Application < Engine
    ...
  end
end
```
This defines Rails::Application class inheriting Rails::Engine, and requires 'rails/engine'.

[rails/engine.rb](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/4-2-stable/railties/lib/rails/engine.rb#L1)
```
require 'rails/railtie'

module Rails
  class Engine < Railtie
    ...
  end
end
```
This defines Rails::Engine class inheriting Rails::Railtie, and requires 'rails/railtie'.

[rails/railtie.rb](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/4-2-stable/railties/lib/rails/railtie.rb#L1-L2)
```
require 'rails/initializable'
require 'rails/configuration'

module Rails
  class Railtie
    include Initializable
    ...
  end
end
```
This defines Rails::Railtie class that includes Rails::Initializable.
Requires two important files 'rails/initializable' and 'rails/configuration'.

[rails/initializable.rb](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/4-2-stable/railties/lib/rails/initializable.rb)
```
module Rails
  module Initializable
    class Initializer
      ...
    end
  end
end
```
This defines Rails::Initializable and Rails::Initializable::Initializer.

What we learned.<br/>
Railties defines these core classes:
```
MyApp::Application < Application < Engine < Railtie < Initializable
```

Railties is the core of Rails.<br/>
It's a library providing something underneath the Rails Application.<br/>
Each component in Rails has it's own Railtie inheriting Rails::Railtie.<br/>
- https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/4-2-stable/actionview/lib/action_view/railtie.rb#L6

- https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/4-2-stable/activesupport/lib/active_support/railtie.rb#L5

Railtie contains config and initializer:
```
module ActiveModel
  class Railtie < Rails::Railtie
    config.eager_load_namespaces << ActiveModel
    initializer 'active_model.secure_password' {}
  end
end
```

[railtie.rb](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/4-2-stable/railties/lib/rails/railtie.rb#L213-L215)
```
module Rails
  class Railtie

    def config
      @config ||= Railtie::Configuration.new
    end

  end
end
```
What is config? It's an instance of Railtie::Configuration.

[railtie/configuration.rb](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/4-2-stable/railties/lib/rails/railtie/configuration.rb#L89-L97)
```
module Rails
  class Railtie
    class Configuration

      def method_missing(name, *args, &blk)
        if name.to_s =~ /=$/
          @@options[$`.to_sym] = args.first
        elsif @@options.key?(name)
          @@options[name]
        else
          super
        end
      end

    end
  end
end
```
Accepts any method call and stores the given method name & value in a class level Hash as {method_name: value}.

[rails/initializable.rb](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/4-2-stable/railties/lib/rails/initializable.rb#L82-L86)
```
module Rails
  module Initializable
    def self.included(base)
      base.extend ClassMethods
    end

    class Initializer
      attr_reader :name, :block

      def initialize(name, context, options, &block)
        options[:group] ||= :default
        @name, @context, @options, @block = name, context, options, block
      end
    end

    module ClassMethods
      def initializer(name, opts = {}, &block)
        ...
        initializers << Initializer.new(name, nil, opts, &block)
      end
    end
  end
end
```
What is initializer? It just keeps the given block as a Proc instance (with a name and options).

What Railtie is doing:
- Setting some values via config.foobar = 'baz'
- Storing Procs given to initializer method calls

What happens when Rails::Railtie is inherited?
```
module Rails
  class Railtie

    def self.inherited(base)
      subclasses << base unless base.abstract_railtie?
    end

  end
end
```
So Railties is the core of Rails, that contains config and initializer.<br/>
Each component in Rails inherited from Railties (ActionView, ActiveRecord, etc..).
