## How Rails server boots (1)

What happens when you type `$ rails server` ?<br/>
Look at your application's 'bin' directory (`bin/rails`).<br/>
It requires 'config/boot' inside the app root, and 'rails/commands'.

[bin/rails](https://github.com/RailsApps/learn-rails/blob/master/bin/rails)
```
require_relative '../config/boot'
require 'rails/commands'
```

[config/boot.rb](https://github.com/RailsApps/learn-rails/blob/master/bin/rails#L7)
```
require 'bundler/setup' if File.exists?(ENV['BUNDLE_GEMFILE'])
```
This sets up gems listed in the Gemfile and tweaks the [$LOAD_PATH](https://github.com/bundler/bundler/blob/master/lib/bundler/setup.rb#L23-L24).

[rails/commands](https://github.com/RailsApps/learn-rails/blob/master/bin/rails#L8)
```
require 'rails/commands'
```
Where is this required 'rails' directory? You can find it in the [railties gem](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/4-2-stable/railties/README.rdoc).
