## Introduction

Rails is a web application framework written in Ruby.<br/>
Let's see what's included in the rails gem `$ git clone rails/rails`.

[rails.gemspec](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/4-2-stable/rails.gemspec#L19)
```
s.files = ['README.md']
```

[rails.gemspec](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/4-2-stable/rails.gemspec#L21-L28)
```
s.add_dependency 'railties',      version
s.add_dependency 'activejob',     version
s.add_dependency 'actionpack',    version
s.add_dependency 'actionview',    version
s.add_dependency 'activemodel',   version
s.add_dependency 'activerecord',  version
s.add_dependency 'actionmailer',  version
s.add_dependency 'activesupport', version
```

It has no code, but instead it defines several dependencies.<br/>
It means that the rails gem is a meta package to install these 8 gems.<br/>
These 8 gems placed in [one repository](https://github.com/rails/rails) and constitute the whole MVC components.
```
# M
# activemodel
# activerecord
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
end

# V
# actionview
app/views/api/user/**/*.html.haml

# C
# actionpack
class UsersController < ActionController::Base
end
```

Summary:<br/>
Rails gem is a meta package that depends on other 8 gems including the whole MVC.
